This was for my internship test for summer 2023-24, program wont work since I deleted some stuff for privacy


I used the Create React App to make this. I spent around 9 hours, that was the limit I gave myself. I wanted to include stuff like a button on signup to go back to login and cleaning up the CSS but ran out of time. I ran a npm test to make sure it was working and also tested signing in and loging in. I did have one issue with it showing my profile info from logging in but ran out of time.

This was a reall cool project to work on (had to brush up on my react skills which as fun), thank you for this opportunity!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
