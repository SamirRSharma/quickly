I used the Create React App to make this. I spent around 10 hours, the limit I gave myself was 9 hours. I wanted to include stuff like a button on signup to go back to login and cleaning up the CSS but ran out of time.

This was a reall cool project to work on (had to brush up on my react skills), thank you for this opportunity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
